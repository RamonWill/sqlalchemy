    Added :meth:`.Select.with_hint` output to the generic SQL string that is
    produced when calling ``str()`` on a statement.  Previously, this clause
    would be omitted under the assumption that it was dialect specific.
    The hint text is presented within brackets to indicate the rendering
    of such hints varies among backends.
