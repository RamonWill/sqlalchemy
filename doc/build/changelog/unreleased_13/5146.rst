    :tickets: 5146

    Fixed regression / incorrect fix caused by fix for :ticket:`5146` where the
    Oracle dialect reads from the "all_tab_comments" view to get table comments
    but fails to accommodate for the current owner of the table being
    requested, causing it to read the wrong comment if multiple tables of the
    same name exist in multiple schemas.
