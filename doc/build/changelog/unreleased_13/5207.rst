    Ensured that the "pyproject.toml" file is not included in builds, as the
    presence of this file indicates to pip that a pep-517 installation process
    should be used.  As this mode of operation appears to be not well supported
    by current tools / distros, these problems are avoided within the scope
    of SQLAlchemy installation by omitting the file.
