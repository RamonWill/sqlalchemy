    :tickets: 5063

    Added support for reflection of "computed" columns, which are now returned
    as part of the structure returned by :meth:`.Inspector.get_columns`.
    When reflecting full :class:`.Table` objects, computed columns will
    be represented using the :class:`.Computed` construct.
