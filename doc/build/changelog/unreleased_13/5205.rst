    Fixed issue where a "covering" index, e.g. those which have an  INCLUDE
    clause, would be reflected including all the columns in INCLUDE clause as
    regular columns.  A warning is now emitted if these additional columns are
    detected indicating that they are currently ignored.  Note that full
    support for "covering" indexes is part of :ticket:`4458`.  Pull request
