    Refined the logic used by the SQL Server dialect to interpret multi-part
    schema names that contain many dots, to not actually lose any dots if the
    name does not have bracking or quoting used, and additionally to support a
    "dbname" token that has many parts including that it may have multiple,
    independently-bracketed sections.
