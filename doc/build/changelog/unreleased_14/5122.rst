    A query that is against a mapped inheritance subclass which also uses
    :meth:`.Query.select_entity_from` or a similar technique in order  to
    provide an existing subquery to SELECT from, will now raise an error if the
    given subquery returns entities that do not correspond to the given
    subclass, that is, they are sibling or superclasses in the same hierarchy.
    Previously, these would be returned without error.  Additionally, if the
    inheritance mapping is a single-inheritance mapping, the given subquery
    must apply the appropriate filtering against the polymorphic discriminator
    column in order to avoid this error; previously, the :class:`.Query` would
    add this criteria to the outside query however this interferes with some
    kinds of query that return other kinds of entities as well.
