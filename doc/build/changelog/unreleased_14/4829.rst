    Added new entity-targeting capabilities to the :class:`_query.Query` object to
    help with the case where the :class:`.Session` is using a bind dictionary
    against mapped classes, rather than a single bind, and the :class:`_query.Query`
    is against a Core statement that was ultimately generated from a method
    such as :meth:`_query.Query.subquery`; a deep search is performed to locate
    any ORM entity related to the query in order to locate a mapper if
    one is not otherwise present.
