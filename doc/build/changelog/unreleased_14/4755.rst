    Deprecated remaining engine-level introspection and utility methods
    including :meth:`.Engine.run_callable`, :meth:`.Engine.transaction`,
    :meth:`.Engine.table_names`, :meth:`.Engine.has_table`.   The utility
    methods are superseded by modern context-manager patterns, and the table
    introspection tasks are suited by the :class:`.Inspector` object.

    The internal dialect method ``Dialect.reflecttable`` has been removed.  A
    review of third party dialects has not found any making use of this method,
    as it was already documented as one that should not be used by external
    dialects.  Additionally, the private ``Engine._run_visitor`` method
    is also removed.

    The long-deprecated ``Inspector.get_table_names.order_by`` parameter has
    been removed.

.. change::
    :tags: feature, engine
    :tickets: 4755

    The :paramref:`.Table.autoload_with` parameter now accepts an :class:`.Inspector` object
    directly, as well as any :class:`.Engine` or :class:`.Connection` as was the case before.
