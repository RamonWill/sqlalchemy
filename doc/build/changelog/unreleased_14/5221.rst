    Enhanced the disambiguating labels feature of the
    :func:`_expression.select` construct such that when a select statement
    is used in a subquery, repeated column names from different tables are now
    automatically labeled with a unique label name, without the need to use the
    full "apply_labels()" feature that conbines tablename plus column name.
    The disambigated labels are available as plain string keys in the .c
    collection of the subquery, and most importantly the feature allows an ORM
    :func:`_orm.aliased` construct against the combination of an entity and an
    arbitrary subquery to work correctly, targeting the correct columns despite
    same-named columns in the source tables, without the need for an "apply
    labels" warning.

        :ref:`migration_20_query_from_self` - Illustrates the new
        disambiguation feature as part of a strategy to migrate away from the
        :meth:`_query.Query.from_self` method.
