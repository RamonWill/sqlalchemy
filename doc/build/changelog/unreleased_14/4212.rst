    An :class:`.ArgumentError` is now raised if both the selectable and flat
    parameters are set to True in :func:`.orm.with_polymorphic`.
    The selectable name is already aliased and applying flat=True
    overrides the selectable name with an anonymous name that would've
    previously caused the code to break. Pull request courtesy Ramon Williams.
