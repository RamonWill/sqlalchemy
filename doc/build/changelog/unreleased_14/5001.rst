    Fixed issue where when constructing constraints from ORM-bound columns,
    primarily :class:`_schema.ForeignKey` objects but also :class:`.UniqueConstraint`,
    :class:`.CheckConstraint` and others, the ORM-level
    :class:`.InstrumentedAttribute` is discarded entirely, and all ORM-level
    annotations from the columns are removed; this is so that the constraints
    are still fully pickleable without the ORM-level entities being pulled in.
    These annotations are not necessary to be present at the schema/metadata
    level.
