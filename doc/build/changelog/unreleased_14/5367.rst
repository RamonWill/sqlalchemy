    The :paramref:`.Enum.create_constraint` and
    :paramref:`.Boolean.create_constraint` parameters now default to False,
    indicating when a so-called "non-native" version of these two datatypes is
    created, a CHECK constraint will not be generated by default.   These CHECK
    constraints present schema-management maintenance complexities that should
    be opted in to, rather than being turned on by default.
