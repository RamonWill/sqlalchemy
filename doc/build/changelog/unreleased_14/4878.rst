    The :paramref:`.case_sensitive` flag on :func:`_sa.create_engine` is
    deprecated; this flag was part of the transition of the result row object
    to allow case sensitive column matching as the default, while providing
    backwards compatibility for the former matching method.   All string access
    for a row should be assumed to be case sensitive just like any other Python
    mapping.
