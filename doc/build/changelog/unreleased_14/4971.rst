    The :class:`.oracle.INTERVAL` class of the Oracle dialect is now correctly
    a subclass of the abstract version of :class:`.Interval` as well as the
    correct "emulated" base class, which allows for correct behavior under both
    native and non-native modes; previously it was only based on
    :class:`.TypeEngine`.
