    An error is raised if any persistence-related "cascade" settings are made
    on a :func:`_orm.relationship` that also sets up viewonly=True.   The "cascade"
    settings now default to non-persistence related settings only when viewonly
    is also set.  This is the continuation from :ticket:`4993` where this
    setting was changed to emit a warning in 1.3.
