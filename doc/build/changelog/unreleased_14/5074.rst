    The :class:`.Session` object no longer initates a
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` object immediately upon construction or after
    the previous transaction is closed; instead, "autobegin" logic now
    initiates the new :class:`.SessionTransaction` on demand when it is next
    needed.  Rationale includes to remove reference cycles from a
    :class:`.Session` that has been closed out, as well as to remove the
    overhead incurred by the creation of :class:`.SessionTransaction` objects
    that are often discarded immediately. This change affects the behavior of
    the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_transaction_create` hook in that the event
    will be emitted when the :class:`.Session` first requires a
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` be present, rather than whenever the
    :class:`.Session` were created or the previous :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    were closed.   Interactions with the :class:`_engine.Engine` and the database
    itself remain unaffected.
