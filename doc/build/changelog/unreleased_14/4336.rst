   Reworked the :meth:`_expression.ClauseElement.compare` methods in terms of a new
   visitor-based approach, and additionally added test coverage ensuring that
   all :class:`_expression.ClauseElement` subclasses can be accurately compared
   against each other in terms of structure.   Structural comparison
   capability is used to a small degree within the ORM currently, however
   it also may form the basis for new caching features.
