    Deprecated the behavior by which a :class:`_schema.Column` can be used as the key
    in a result set row lookup, when that :class:`_schema.Column` is not part of the
    SQL selectable that is being selected; that is, it is only matched on name.
    A deprecation warning is now emitted for this case.   Various ORM use
    cases, such as those involving :func:`_expression.text` constructs, have been improved
    so that this fallback logic is avoided in most cases.
