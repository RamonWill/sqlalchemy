    The refresh of an expired object will now trigger an autoflush if the list
    of expired attributes include one or more attributes that were explicitly
    expired or refreshed using the :meth:`.Session.expire` or
    :meth:`.Session.refresh` methods.   This is an attempt to find a middle
    ground between the normal unexpiry of attributes that can happen in many
    cases where autoflush is not desirable, vs. the case where attributes are
    being explicitly expired or refreshed and it is possible that these
    attributes depend upon other pending state within the session that needs to
    be flushed.   The two methods now also gain a new flag
    :paramref:`.Session.expire.autoflush` and
    :paramref:`.Session.refresh.autoflush`, defaulting to True; when set to
    False, this will disable the autoflush that occurs on unexpire for these
    attributes.
