    :tags: mysql, usecase
    :tickets: 4976

    Added support for use of the :class:`.Sequence` construct with MariaDB 10.3
    and greater, as this is now supported by this database.  The construct
    integrates with the :class:`.Table` object in the same way that it does for
    other databases like PostrgreSQL and Oracle; if is present on the integer
    primary key "autoincrement" column, it is used to generate defaults.   For
    backwards compatibility, to support a :class:`.Table` that has a
    :class:`.Sequence` on it to support sequence only databases like Oracle,
    while still not having the sequence fire off for MariaDB, the optional=True
    flag should be set, which indicates the sequence should only be used to
    generate the primary key if the target database offers no other option.
