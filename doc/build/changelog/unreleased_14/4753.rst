    The :func:`~.sql.expression.select` construct and related constructs now allow for
    duplication of column labels and columns themselves in the columns clause,
    mirroring exactly how column expressions were passed in.   This allows
    the tuples returned by an executed result to match what was SELECTed
    for in the first place, which is how the ORM :class:`.Query` works, so
    this establishes better cross-compatibility between the two constructs.
    Additionally, it allows column-positioning-sensitive structures such as
    UNIONs (i.e. :class:`.CompoundSelect`) to be more intuitively constructed
    in those cases where a particular column might appear in more than one
    place.   To support this change, the :class:`.ColumnCollection` has been
    revised to support duplicate columns as well as to allow integer index
    access.
