    :tickets: 4235, 4633

    Added support for "CREATE SEQUENCE" and full :class:`.Sequence` support for
    Microsoft SQL Server.  This removes the deprecated feature of using
    :class:`.Sequence` objects to manipulate IDENTITY characteristics which
    should now be performed using ``mssql_identity_start`` and
    ``mssql_identity_increment`` as documented at :ref:`mssql_identity`. The
    change includes a new parameter :paramref:`.Sequence.data_type` to
    accommodate SQL Server's choice of datatype, which for that backend
    includes INTEGER, BIGINT, and DECIMAL(n, 0).   The default starting value
    for SQL Server's version of :class:`.Sequence` has been set at 1; this
    default is now emitted within the CREATE SEQUENCE DDL for all backends.
