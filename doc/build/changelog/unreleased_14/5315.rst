    Disabled the "unicode returns" check that runs on dialect startup when
    running under Python 3, which for many years has occurred in order to test
    the current DBAPI's behavior for whether or not it returns Python Unicode
    or Py2K strings for the VARCHAR and NVARCHAR datatypes.  The check still
    occurs by default under Python 2, however the mechanism to test the
    behavior will be removed in SQLAlchemy 2.0 when Python 2 support is also
    removed.

    This logic was very effective when it was needed, however now that Python 3
    is standard, all DBAPIs are expected to return Python 3 strings for
    character datatypes.  In the unlikely case that a third party DBAPI does
    not support this, the conversion logic within :class:`.String` is still
    available and the third party dialect may specify this in its upfront
    dialect flags by setting the dialect level flag ``returns_unicode_strings``
    to one of :attr:`.String.RETURNS_CONDITIONAL` or
    :attr:`.String.RETURNS_BYTES`, both of which will enable Unicode conversion
    even under Python 3.
