    Fixed bug where a versioning column specified on a mapper against a
    :func:`_expression.select` construct where the version_id_col itself were against the
    underlying table would incur additional loads when accessed, even if the
    value were locally persisted by the flush.  The actual fix is a result of
    the changes in :ticket:`4617`,  by fact that a :func:`_expression.select` object no
    longer has a ``.c`` attribute and therefore does not confuse the mapper
    into thinking there's an unknown column value present.
