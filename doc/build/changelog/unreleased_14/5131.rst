    The :meth:`.Connection.connect` method is deprecated as is the concept of
    "connection branching", which copies a :class:`.Connection` into a new one
    that has a no-op ".close()" method.  This pattern is oriented around the
    "connectionless execution" concept which is also being removed in 2.0.
